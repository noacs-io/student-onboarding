# Project 20 weeks

Most projects that we supervise run for 20 weeks, which is equivalent
to one semester in Swedish universities. We recommend that you put in
a lot of work during the first 10 weeks, and even more so during the
initial four weeks, to make sure that you meet project deadlines and
achieve the desired learning outcomes. The timeline here is a
suggestion that we've found to work well for most projects.

## Week 1

- Join the team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/CFEY2RUUDX) and say
  hello. This is where you will receive your server login details.
- Read the [expectations](./expectations.md).
- Setup your coding environment
  - Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and login
  - Fork your project repo from noacs to your own account by
    navigating to your project on noacs and clicking Fork in the upper
    right corner
  - Navigate to
    [https://github.com/settings/tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
  - Create a token with "Expiration: No expiration" and select the
    "repo" scope.
  - Copy the token from the blue box and store it how you store
    passwords. This will be used to fetch & save your code to Github
    and is a sensitive piece of information.
  - Navigate to our Rstudio instance and login:
    [https://rstudio.test.noacs.io](https://rstudio.test.noacs.io)
  - Copy the link to the repository in your account, should be
    something like https://github.com/username/repo
  - Create a new project in Rstudio, select "From version control",
    enter the URL and follow the instructions. When it asks for your
    password use the token generated before.
- Try [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html), start from Step
  3.
- Read up.

## Week 2

- Draft the introduction (~ 3 paragraphs, each 5 lines) and methods parts of the manuscript in the file `manuscript.Rmd` based on the appropriate study reporting guideline, for example [STROBE](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/) or [TRIPOD](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/tripod-statement/). For inspiration see for example https://sjtrem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13049-023-01157-y or https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/2/e068219.long.
- Draft the project plan [sv: projektredogörelse] in the file `project-plan.Rmd`based on the guidelines from your university. Use the text you wrote for the manuscript.
- Read up.

## Week 3

- Start writing code and upload a first script that imports and begin to clean the data.
- Revise the manuscript based on feedback.
- Read up.

## Week 4

- Revise code based on feedback.
- Add code that creates a first table of sample characteristics.
- Revise project plan [sv: projektredogörelse] based on feedback and submit.
- Read up.

## Week 5-10
