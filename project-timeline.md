# Project 20 weeks

Most projects that I supervise run for 20 weeks, which is equivalent to one semester in Swedish universities. I recommend that you put in a
lot of work during the first 10 weeks, and even more so during the initial four weeks, to make sure that you meet project deadlines and
achieve the desired learning outcomes. The timeline here is a suggestion that I've found to work well for most projects.

## Week 1

- Join the team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/CFEY2RUUDX) and say hello.
- Read up.
- Draft a [project plan](project-plan.md) [sv: projektredogörelse] based on the appropriate study reporting guideline, for example
  [STROBE](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/) or
  [TRIPOD](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/tripod-statement/), and upload to your project repository.

### Setup your coding environment

- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and login.
  - Navigate to [https://github.com/settings/tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
  - Create a token with "Expiration: No expiration" and select the "repo" scope.
  - Copy the token from the blue box and store it how you store passwords. This will be used to fetch & save your code to Github and is a
    sensitive piece of information.
- Install R and RStudio on your computer (or use our Rstudio instance: [https://rstudio.test.noacs.io](https://rstudio.test.noacs.io))
  - Try [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html).
- Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
  - Copy the link to the repository in your account, should be something like https://github.com/username/repo
  - Create a new project in Rstudio, select "From version control", enter the URL and follow the instructions. When it asks for your
    password use the token generated before.

## Week 2

- Revise your project plan based on feedback.

## Week 11-12

- Draft the Results section and upload.
