Introduction
============

*This is part A) in the project plan [sv: projektredogörelse]. *


*The background/introduction should summarise the scope of the problem,
what is known about the problem, what is not known, what specific
knowledge gap the study is supposed to fill and why this is
important. It should end be stating the aim of the study. The
background should be 4-5 paragraphs long and each paragraph should be
between 3-5 sentences. Strive to make the paragraphs about the same
length.*

*bibliography.bib includes an example reference. Add additional
references in that file as bibtex entries and then cite in text using:
"[@exampleKey9999]". One can convert DOIs' to bibtex entries using 
https://www.doi2bib.org/. If you use Zotero you can simply export 
entries to bibtex `Ctrl-Shift-C`, however you need to first setup 
Quick Copy to export to bibtex (https://www.zotero.org/support/creating_bibliographies#quick_copy)*

Methods
=======

*Refer to the appropriate reporting guideline for details. If you are
developing, updating or validating a clinical prediction model then
use
[TRIPOD](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/tripod-statement/). If
you are conducting an observational study, for example a cohort or
case control study in which you assess associations between some
exposure and an outcome then use
[STROBE](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/).*
