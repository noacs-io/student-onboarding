# Welcome!

## We are very happy that you are considering taking on a project with our lab!

The [No Accidents (NOACS)](https://ki.se/en/gph/research/research-groups-at-gph/health-systems-and-policy/no-accidents-improving-trauma-systems)<!--([NOACS](https://noacs.io))--> lab conducts research to strengthen the systems required to care for trauma patients, by preventing and predicting mortality and morbidity after trauma. 

Our research is based primarily in Sweden and India and it is funded by the Swedish Research Council and the Laerdal Foundation.

This repository includes information that applies to most projects that we supervise. It also outlines  expectations on our collaboration, and what you can expect from us as supervisors. 

To get the most out of this repository start by reading the [project timeline](project-timeline.md) and then about our [expectations](expectations.md). 

## Supervision structure

You will have a at least two supervisors, one main and one co-supervisor, but sometimes more. Most of your day to day contacts and meetings will be with your co-supervisor, but you will also meet with your main supervisor. A majority of the supervision is online, but there is often possible to arrange in-person meetings. We have weekly check-ins every Thursday at 10.00 CEST, in which you will meet at least one of the lab members, and monthly lab meetings.

## Resources

### Git

#### [Git in Rstudio](https://www.geo.uzh.ch/microsite/reproducible_research/post/rr-rstudio-git/)

Use our Rstudio instance and only step 3 and 4 are needed.

### R

#### [Swirl - "Learn R, in R"](https://swirlstats.com/students.html) 

A great way to get started with R. Use our RStudio instance and follow
along from Step 3

#### [Our coding club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials.html)

Developed by researchers at Edinburgh Uni. They have many great
follow-along tutorials from the very basics to more advanced
topics. Previous students have found this very useful.

#### [R Programming Tutorial - Learn the Basics of Statistical Computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V8eKsto3Ug)

A shorter, 2 hour follow-along tutorial on YouTube. A good starting
point.

### R Markdown

#### [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html)

A good and short introduction for someone who has never used R
Markdown before.

#### [R Markdown Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K418swtFnik)
