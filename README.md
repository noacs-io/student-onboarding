# Welcome!

## We are very happy that you are considering taking on a project with our lab!

The No Accidents <!--([NOACS](https://noacs.io))--> lab researches how to predict and prevent morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, by developing and validating prediction models for early trauma care and evaluating system level interventions for improved trauma care. 

Our research is based primarily in Sweden and India and it is funded by the Swedish Research Council and the Laerdal Foundation.

This repository includes information that applies to most projects that we supervise. It also outlines  expectations on our collaboration, and what you can expect from us as supervisors. 

To get the most out of this repository start by reading the [project timeline](project-timeline.md) and then about our [expectations](expectations.md). 

## Supervision structure

## Resources

### Git

#### [Git in Rstudio](https://www.geo.uzh.ch/microsite/reproducible_research/post/rr-rstudio-git/)

Use our Rstudio instance and only step 3 and 4 are needed.

### R

#### [Swirl - "Learn R, in R"](https://swirlstats.com/students.html) 

A great way to get started with R. Use our RStudio instance and follow
along from Step 3

#### [Our coding club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials.html)

Developed by researchers at Edinburgh Uni. They have many great
follow-along tutorials from the very basics to more advanced
topics. Previous students have found this very useful.

#### [R Programming Tutorial - Learn the Basics of Statistical Computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V8eKsto3Ug)

A shorter, 2 hour follow-along tutorial on YouTube. A good starting
point.

### R Markdown

#### [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html)
