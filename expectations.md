# Our expectations of you as the student

- To participate in the weekly check-ins and monthly lab meetings. They are online.
- Complete a project timeline using issues with deadlines in your Github repository. Use the [generic timeline](project-timeline.md) as support.
- Keep meeting notes and make these accessible to us on request.
- After each check-in, add the tasks to be completed until the next check-in as issues in your GitHub repository.
- Submit on deadline. We don't expect submissions to be perfect but we expect them to be on time. 
- If you for some reason cannot keep the deadline then make sure to inform your supervisors.
- Respond to emails and messages on Discord as soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours.
- We manage every project as if it would result in a publication in a international peer-reviewed journal. We expect you to be interested in this endpoint as well.
  
# What you can expect from us as supervisors

- To keep deadlines.
- To reply to emails/messages on Discord within 48 hours (sooner if you
  specifically ask us to).
- Comment on written work within 5 days from submission.
- To be closely involved with the project and invest time and effort
  in your supervision.
