# Our expectations of you as the student

- To participate in our monthly lab meetings. They are online.
- Complete a detailed project timeline with relevant dates based on the [generic timeline](project-timeline.md).
- Arrange weekly or bi-weekly phone meetings, with your co-supervisor(s).
- Keep detailed meeting notes and make these accessible to us (for example
  as a markdown document in the project repository).
- Submit on deadline. We don't expect submissions to be perfect or
  final but we expect them to be on time. 
- If you for some reason cannot keep the deadline then make sure to
  inform your supervisors.
- Respond to emails and messages on Discord as soon as possible, but no
  later than 48 hours.
- We manage every project as if it would result in a publication in a
  international peer-reviewed journal. We expect you to be interested
  in this endpoint as well.
  
# What you can expect from us as supervisors

- To keep deadlines.
- To reply to emails/messages on Discord within 48 hours (sooner if you
  specifically ask us to).
- Comment on written work within 5 days from submission.
- To be closely involved with the project and invest time and effort
  in your supervision.
